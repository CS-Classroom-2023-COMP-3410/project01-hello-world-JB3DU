Notes on the slides:
the internet is "Giants on giants on top of giants"
Interdependencies
Essentials will be covered, other matters are too big to cover.
Practical, non-theoretical
Web is a mishmash of technologies mashed together
Technology stacks, languages, frameworks
Software engineering instead of compsci

Will cover HTML+CSS+Javascript, (Two weeks on each)
lxml,Pippeteer,Peewee
HTTP,nginx,node.js,sqlite
Bulma,Flask, express.js
Breadth-first rather than depth-first. 
Meant to familiarize us on each part of the process
Won't be a CSS selector guru by the end 

Learning will be  via time and exposure


These skills are very employable: both tech and non-tech companies need it
A lot of companies, such as facebook and twitter, started as just websites
